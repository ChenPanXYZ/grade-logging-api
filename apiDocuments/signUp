# Sign up

The API to sign up a "UTORid" into this system.

Note:
1. Even though we call it "UTORid", you don't have to sign up with your real UTORid. You can use any ids you want, if not taken by someone else already.
2. You need to copy and paste the returned token immediately. The token will only be shown once. If you forget the token, you need to sign up with a different id.

**URL** : `/signUp?utorid=`

**Method** : `GET`

**Auth required** : Required in header `Authorization`.

**Required Request Parameters**
```json
{
    "utorid": "The ID (doesn't have to be your real utorid)"
}
```
## Success Responses

**Condition** : Access to the utorid's grades is verified by the authorization token, and a grade for the course has been logged before.

**Code** : `200 OK`

**Content example** : 

```json
{
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Token generated successfully",

}
```

## Error Response

### UTORid not available.

{
    "status_code": 200,
    "message": "Someone took this username. If you are not the owner of this username or you forgot your token, please sign up with a different username and use the new token instead."
}
```
